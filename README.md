# CS162
This repository is storage for the various lab assignment from CS162++, focusing on C++. This class covered arrays, sorting, searching, structs, classes, pointers/memory allocation, linked lists, and recursions. We spent a lot of time focusing on pointers via exploring classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and then added a twist with linked lists and recursion.
